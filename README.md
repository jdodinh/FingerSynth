## Introduction
Interestingly enough, similarly to my MUMT306 project, the inspiration for this project also has ties to Daft Punk's music. It was while scrolling through instagram one day that I stumbled someone suggesting to check out a video of someone recreating some of Daft Punk's tracks using this small pocket synthesizer called a 'Stylophone'. The link to the video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dllfRLUX5xk). I found the stylophone to be an expremely cool invention, and especially I thoroughly enjoyed what the creator *maromaro1337* did with the invention.

Consequently, while I was initially settled on creating some sort of plug in for a DAW of some kind, I quickly saw that with the tools presented in MUMT307 throughout the semester I could attempt to recreate a simiar and perhaps enhanced version of instrument in pure digital format. I found that the Synthesis ToolKit provides more than enough functionality to make the implementation of such a tool possible, and therefore I quickly decided to change my topic idea. The following sections describe the project's technical details, gives insight into the development process and highlights areas of improvement and paths further exploration and development of the project.
